## Installation

In order to run the program, there is a CMakeList file to build and make the executable. Make sure you have the [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) installed and create the folder where the build will be generated.

On Linux:
```sh
mkdir cmake-build && cd cmake-build
cmake ../
```

This will compile the source code outputting a single executable inside the build folder called LIFE.
